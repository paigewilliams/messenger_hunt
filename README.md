## Description

Message Hunter is a hot new geolocation social networking app that makes messaging _fun_ again.

Users can log in, check in anywhere in the world, and leave location-specific messages for other users to find.

Your personal dashboard shows the running total of unfound messages waiting somewhere for you to discover.

If you check in near the location of a message sent to you by another user, a special notification will appear, granting you access to view and save your special hidden message.

What fun!!!

Found messages are saved to your dashboard for future nostalgic reading.

Travel the world with Message Hunter, leaving a trail of hidden messages for friends to discover as they embark on their own journey of global self-discovery.

**Happy hunting!**
